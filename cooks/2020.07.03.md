### the cook
Having some family over for our July 4th gathering today, hoping to provide some delicious barbecue.  Today started out well, Got up in time to start the fire at 4 am. The fire was an easy start, and got some cherry on quickly.  Trimmed the brisket last night, which was much easier than past cooks.  Sarah and the kids got me knife sharpern for father's day and the sharpness of the knife is amazing.  I put the salt an pepper on it this morning and tossed it on the cooker around 5.  Fat side up twoards the middle of the box.

#### fire management
Started today with a full chimney of coals, then added two logs initally.  Temperatures have hovered around 275-320, which is fine - maybe a little cooler would be better?  Smoke has been mostly clean - had an incodent around 6 am with a new log i think was a bit wet.
