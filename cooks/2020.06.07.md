### the cook
we typically try to cook one or two meals a week that produce left overs that can be used in a myirad of ways. So today i'm cooking some pulled pork.  Not only does it produce good food, but it lets me practice my fire maintence.  So, while we're waiting for the cost of brisket to come down, the meat i really want to cook lately, i'm practicing fire managment with pork.

What I've learned so far with this cooker is that i have to build a slightly larger fire than my last cooker.  This makes sense, because its larger, but another thing i am happy to see is that because the cooker is slightly larger, i'm seeing more consistant temperatures for longer periods of time.  This could also be because the metal is also thicker, which insulates and holds temp better.

#### fire management
I typically start the grill with chimney of charcoal, and add two logs for the fire.  this will hold temp and burn for about 45 minutes to an hour. Last cook, i played with adding one or two logs per hour, my last cooker i could add a log every hour to every nintey minutes.  with this cooker it's become clear adding one log every hour or so will hold a consitant temperature of around 300 degrees.  I'm okay with that!
