## Welcome Mcgalliard Barbecue Log

I'm going to use this git repo to document some of my barbecue cooks.  I cook on an offset texas style cooker, which burns charcoal and wood, but primarily wood.  Its the most tactile thing I do and involves very little digital tools (just bluethooth enabled thermometers).  Nothing special here :)

feel free to open an issue with comments / suggestions.
